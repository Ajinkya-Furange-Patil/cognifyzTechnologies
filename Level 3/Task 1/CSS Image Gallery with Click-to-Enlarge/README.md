# Click-to-Enlarge Photo Gallery

A simple photo gallery where you click thumbnails to see them bigger. No fancy JavaScript popups, just CSS doing its thing.

## How it works

- Click & hold any photo to enlarge it
- Uses the `:active` pseudo-class for the magic

## Files

- gallery.html - The photo grid
- gallery.css - All the styling and enlargement effects

## Notes

- Photos are random from Picsum (quality varies, but hey, they're free!)
- Works on mobile too, just smaller enlargements
- Hover effects included because why not

## Ideas for improvement

- Add actual photo descriptions
- Replace with your own photos
- Add keyboard navigation (Esc to close)
