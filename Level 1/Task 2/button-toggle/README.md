# Click Color Button

A small demo where a button changes color when clicked. Nothing groundbreaking, just a clean toggle to show basic JS interaction.

## Files

- index.html â€” markup + button
- styles.css â€” some neat styling and a subtle shadow
- script.js â€” adds the click behavior

## How to run

- Open `index.html` in your browser. Thatâ€™s literally it.

## What it does

- Toggles a CSS class on click to swap colors
- Changes the button text (tiny UX detail)

## Known quirks

- Only two colors for now (blue <-> orange)
- No local storage, so state resets on refresh

## Ideas for later

- Random colors (but keep contrast readable)
- Add a disabled state after N clicks (why? not sure ðŸ˜„)
- A ripple effect would be fun
