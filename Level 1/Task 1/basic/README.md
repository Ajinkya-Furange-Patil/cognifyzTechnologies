# Simple Webpage Project

A basic HTML and CSS webpage demonstrating fundamental web development concepts with heading, paragraph, and image elements.

## What's Inside

Just a simple webpage that I built to practice HTML and CSS basics. Nothing too fancy but it does the job!

## Project Structure

```
basic/
├── index.html  - The main webpage file
├── styles.css  - CSS styling
└── README.md
```
## Features

- Clean, centered layout with container design
- Responsive design (works on mobile too)
- Simple typography with good readability
- Subtle box shadows for modern look

## How to Use

1. Download both files to the same folder
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser
3. That's it! Pretty straightforward.

## What I Learned

- Basic HTML structure and semantic elements
- CSS layout with flexbox and centering
- Responsive design using media queries
- Adding external images
- Box shadows and border radius for modern styling

## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers:

- Chrome ✅
- Firefox ✅
- Safari ✅
- Edge ✅

## Future Improvements

Maybe I'll add:

- More interactive elements
- Better color scheme
- Animation effects
- More content sections

## License

Feel free to use this code however you want. It's pretty basic stuff anyway!
