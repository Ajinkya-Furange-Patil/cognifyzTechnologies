# Contact Form Project

A simple HTML contact form with email input and submit functionality, styled with modern CSS.

## About This Project

Built this basic contact form to practice form handling and CSS styling. It's got a nice gradient background and some smooth animations - nothing crazy but looks pretty decent!

## Project Structure

```
contact-form/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── README.md
```

## Files Description

- **index.html** - Main HTML file with the contact form
- **styles.css** - All the styling magic happens here

## Features & Functionality

### Form Elements

- Email input field with validation
- Submit button with hover effects
- Required field validation (browser handles this)
- Responsive design for mobile devices

### Styling Highlights

- Purple gradient background (looks pretty cool tbh)
- Card-style form container with shadow
- Smooth transitions and hover animations
- Focus states for better accessibility
- Mobile-friendly responsive layout

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Any modern web browser
- That's literally it!

### Installation & Setup

1. Download the files to your computer
2. Make sure both HTML and CSS files are in the same directory
3. Double-click `index.html` to open in browser
4. Start using the form!

## How It Works

The form currently:

- Collects email addresses
- Validates email format (browser built-in)
- Shows nice visual feedback on interaction
- **Note:** Doesn't actually send emails yet (need backend for that)

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and working on:

- ✅ Chrome (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest)
- ✅ Edge (latest)
- ✅ Mobile browsers

## Known Issues

- Form doesn't actually submit anywhere (No action attribute set))
- No server-side processing
- Could use more input validation
- Missing loading state on submit

## Future Enhancements

Planning to add:

- [ ] Backend integration (Node.js)
- [ ] More form fields (name, message, etc.)
- [ ] Better error handling
- [ ] Success/failure messages
- [ ] Email sending functionality
- [ ] Form submission animations

## Customization

### Colors

Main colors used:

- Primary: `#667eea` (purple-blue)
- Secondary: `#764ba2` (deeper purple)
- Text: `#333` (dark gray)

### Fonts

Using system fonts for better performance:

- Primary: `'Segoe UI', Arial, sans-serif`

## Technical Details

### CSS Features Used

- Linear gradients for background

### HTML5 Features
