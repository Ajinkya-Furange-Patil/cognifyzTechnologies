# Hamburger Menu (Pure CSS)

A navigation bar that becomes a hamburger on smaller screens without a single line of JavaScript. Checkbox sorcery inside.

## How to run

- Open `nav.html`
- Shrink the browser until the hamburger appears
- Click the hamburger. Behold.

## Notes

- Keyboard focus works on the hidden checkbox (weâ€™re not monsters)
- Could add ARIA attributes with JS for extra accessibility points later
