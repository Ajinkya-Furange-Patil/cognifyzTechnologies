# Responsive Page (Media Queries Edition)

A basic page that reshapes itself like a flexible cat — 3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile. Nothing wild, just clean CSS with some jokes sprinkled in.

## How to run

- Open `index.html` (internet optional, images are placeholders)
- Resize the window and nod approvingly

## Breakpoints (ish)

- ≤ 600px: single column (phone pocket mode)
- ≤ 992px: two columns (tablet diet)
- > 992px: three columns (desktop flex)
