# Bulma Card (Image + Text)

A simple, responsive card using Bulma. Includes an image, title, subtitle, content, and a couple of buttons. Added tiny custom CSS so it doesnâ€™t look 100% boilerplate.

## Why Bulma?

- Class-based and lightweight
- Mobile-first columns system
- Cards look good with minimal effort

## How to run

- Open `index.html` in a browser (CDN style, so internet required for Bulma)
- Resize your window to see how columns wrap

## Notes

- Images are from placeholder services; sometimes they change on refresh
- Added a second card to show wrapping behavior

## Ideas to try

- Add a footer area to the card
- Replace placeholder images with your project assets
- Add tags with different colors to see visual variety
