# Bootstrap Responsive Grid

A basic responsive grid layout using Bootstrap 5. It shows three variations:

1. Fixed columns that change count per breakpoint (1 → 2 → 4)
2. A typical main + sidebar layout with nested rows
3. Auto-layout using `row-cols-*` utilities

## Why Bootstrap here?

- Familiar grid system
- Easy breakpoints (`col-`, `col-md-`, `col-lg-`, etc.)
- Works well for quick prototyping

## How to run

- Open `index.html` (internet required for CDN)
- Resize the browser to see items reflow

## Notes

- The `.box` class is custom to visualize columns

## Ideas for future.

- Make cards inside each column
- Add images and test equal-height behavior
- Try `order-*` utilities to rearrange on mobile
